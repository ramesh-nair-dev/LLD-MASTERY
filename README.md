# 🧠 LLD Mastery – A Living Knowledge Base

This repository is not just code — it’s a **systematic exploration of Low-Level Design (LLD)**, blending deep theory with practical applications.  
It reflects how I approach engineering: **clarity first, then code**.  

---

## 🚀 What This Repo Represents

- **Structured Knowledge** → Curated notes on **object-oriented design, design patterns, and principles**.  
- **Hands-On Practice** → Every concept reinforced through **mini-projects and real implementations**.  
- **Long-Term Thinking** → Built as a reference library that grows with experience.  

Recruiters and peers should read this as: *“Not just someone who codes features, but someone who engineers systems with intent.”*

## 📚 Covered Topics

- SOLID Principles explained with practical scenarios.  
- Core Design Patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral) with notes & examples.  
- Step-by-step breakdowns of how patterns apply in real-world systems.  
- Insights documented in a way that makes this repo a **personal playbook for scalable design**.

## 🛠️ Applied Mastery – Practice Projects

These projects extend the notes into **real-world, working systems**:  

- 🎮 [TicTacToe](https://github.com/ramesh-nair-dev/TicTacToe) – Classic game built with OOP & Builder Pattern.  
- 🅿️ [Parking Lot](https://github.com/ramesh-nair-dev/Parkinglot) – Object-oriented modeling of real-world parking management.  
- 🎟️ [BookMyShow](https://github.com/ramesh-nair-dev/BookMyShow) – Ticket booking system with layered architecture & clean abstractions.  
- 💸 [SplitWise](https://github.com/ramesh-nair-dev/SplitWise) – Expense sharing platform with service-oriented breakdown.
- 🐍 [Snake And Ladder](https://github.com/ramesh-nair-dev/Snake-and-Ladder/tree/main) - Snake and Ladder game with OOP & (Builder + Strategy) Pattern

## 🧩 Why This Matters

- Shows **ability to think beyond CRUD** → focus on design, maintainability, and scalability.  
- Demonstrates **architectural awareness** → not just solving problems, but solving them elegantly.  
- Acts as a **signal of depth** → documenting + implementing = real mastery.
